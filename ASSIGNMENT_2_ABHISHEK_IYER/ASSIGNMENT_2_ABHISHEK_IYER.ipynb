      "Long time ago there lived a King He was lazy and liked all the comforts of life He never carried out his duties as a King Our King does not take care of our needs He also ignores the affairs of his kingdom The people complained One day the King went into the forest to hunt After having wandered for quite sometime he became thirsty To his relief he spotted a lake As he was drinking water he suddenly saw a golden swan come out of the lake and perch on a stone Oh! A golden swan I must capture it thought the King But as soon as he held his bow up the swan disappeared And the King heard a voice I am the Golden Swan If you want to capture me you must come to heaven Surprised the King said Please show me the way to heaven Do good deeds serve your people and the messenger from heaven would come to fetch you to heaven replied the voice The selfish King eager to capture the Swan tried doing some good deeds in his Kingdom Now I suppose a messenger will come to take me to heaven he thought But no messenger came The King then disguised himself and went out into the street There he tried helping an old man But the old man became angry and said You need not try to help I am in this miserable state because of out selfish King He has done nothing for his people Suddenly the King heard the golden swan’s voice Do good deeds and you will come to heaven It dawned on the King that by doing selfish acts he will not go to heaven He realized that his people needed him and carrying out his duties was the only way to heaven After that day he became a responsible King \n"
